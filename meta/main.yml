  description:
    Ansible role to automate the set-up of Autobrr - like autodl-irssi... but better.
      - Includes the installation of Docker (Debian-based distros) and Ansible dependencies within the role.
      - Includes the option of setting up and connecting Autobrr to a Postgres database.
      - Includes the option of setting up Omegabrr - easing the filter creation process when connected with arrs.
      - Includes the option of creating a Cloudflare DNS record for your Autobrr instance for reverse proxy purposes.
      - Includes the option of joining Lidarr to an existing Traefik docker network (or creating one if none exists).
